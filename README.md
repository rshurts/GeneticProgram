# Genetic Program

Class project of SEIS 610 Software Engineering at the University of St. Thomas.

## Problem Description

Given a set of test data, where f(x) = (x^2 - 1) / 2, randomly generate a set of solutions. Evaluate each solution to see how closely it matches f(x) = (x^2 - 1) / 2. The genetic program should evolve the solutions until one is found that is equivalent to f(x) = (x^2 - 1) / 2.

## Implementation

A genetic program in C++ using binary trees.

Training data used:
